# Project 1 Description
## Topic: User choice

Write a program that meets the following criteria. You may choose the topic and style. Feel free to do something that relates to another class, a hobby or interest, or just sounds interesting.

Start by mapping your idea out in pseudocode, then writing the program. You will probably need to go back and forth as the program evolves, but it's important to figure out the logic *before* starting to write the program!

### Criteria
Your program should include a minimum of: 
* 1 list (3 or more elements)                                     #DONE (The answer lists and the user_list)
* manipulation of the list in some way                            #DONE (appending input into list)
* 1 while loop                                                    #DONE (while play_again == 1:)
* 1 conditional (if-elif-else)                                    #DONE (Many conditionals)
* 1 for loop                                                      #DONE(for x in range (4):)
* 1 function that does something other than just print            #DONE (Both functions have conditionals and other features)
* function should be called at least 2x                           #DONE (Both functions can be called as many times as the user plays)
* 2 types of variables                                            #DONE (play_again & number_of_moves & many others)
* Try/except                                                      #DONE (makes them enter an integer)
* Comments - use them!                                            #DONE
* Collaborators (as usual)                                        #DONE

### Functionality
Your program should:
* Take input and use that as part of the program
* Respond appropriately to bad input
* Include proper formatting, including spacing, order of elements, etc.
* Be customizable by the user. (If the user inputs something, x happens, if the input is y then x happens, etc.

### Other elements
* Edit README in GitHub with description of your project and any important information.
* Include pseudocode "map" of your project on GitHub.
  * This can be uploaded as a file or written in GitHub (there is a file in the repo already)
  * You may use bullet points/lists, flow charts, or some combination. 
* Note that there are many things we haven't covered. If you want to do something and you don't know how, feel free to ask!
