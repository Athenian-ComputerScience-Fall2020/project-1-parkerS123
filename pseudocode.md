# Pseudocode for this program
(this can be in a flowchart, using bullet points, inserting a picture, etc)

1) I need to input the answers for the code
    * Research the fastest ways to win the copycat strategy then choose a few combinations
    * make the moves part of a list and make the list equal to answer1 or answer2
2) Prompt the user about how to play
    * various print and input statements to get them to understand how to enter the right coordinates
3) The user playes the game and they enter the places on the board they think pieces go 
    * for loop because only a certain amount of turns
    * append their coordinates to a list and at the end ask if their list eqauls any of the answers
        * If they get it right they win and did a great job... Play again
        * Can choose if they want a hint, and which hint number
        * If they lose they can keep trying... Play again and tell them to make sure to enter the coordinates exactly right
