# Project 1

**For this project I want to create a code that teaches the user the fastest and best ways to beat the copy cat in chess**
 * To make this code work I would need to create an asnswer by printing moves (E2-E4,G1-G3) < like that
 * They would have to input moves and specify which piece is moving, for example pawn moving from E2 to E4 would be PE2-E4
 * I would probably make more than one solution to the answer, but then after a certain number of moves I would say they didn't find it in time
 * I would suggest that the user should have a chess board so they know how to enter moves correctly
 * After every move they make they would move the "computer" to the square that corresponds to where they went
 * After they input all their moves it will say if they are right or wrong
    * If right they can choose to play again
    * If wrong they can get a hint --> then choose to play again
