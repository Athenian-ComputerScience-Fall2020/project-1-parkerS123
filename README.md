# Project 1

Explain what your project does here.

**For this project I want to create a code that teaches the user the fastest and best ways to beat the copy cat in chess**
 * To make this code work I would need to create an asnswer by printing moves (E2-E4,G1-G3) < like that
 * They would have to input moves and specify which piece is moving, for example pawn moving from E2 to E4 would be PE2-E4
 * I would probably make more than one solution to the answer, but then after a certain number of moves I would say they didn't find it in time
 * I would suggest that the user should have a chess board so they know how to enter moves correctly
 * After every move they make they would move the "computer" to the square that corresponds to where they went

When you are done, delete everything else on this page. It is only here for reference.
